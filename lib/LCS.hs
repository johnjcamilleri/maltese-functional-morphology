{- $algorithm
We take two sequences, @xs@ and @ys@, of length @\#xs@ and @\#ys@.

First we make an array

> matchlist[i=0..(#xs-1)]

such that

> (matchlist[i] = js) => ((j `elem` js) <=> (xs !! i == ys !! j))
>                     && sort js == reverse js

i.e. @matchlist[i]@ is the indices of elements of @ys@ equal to the
ith element of @xs@, in descending order.

Let @\#xys@ be the minimum of @\#xs@ and @\#ys@. Trivially this is the maximum
possible length of the LCS of @xs@ and @ys@. Then we can imagine an array

> k[i=0..#xs][l=0..#xys]

such that @k[i][l] = j@ where @j@ is the smallest value such that the
LCS of @xs[0..i]@ and @ys[0..j]@ has length @l@. We use @\#ys@ to
mean there is no such @j@.

We will not need to whole array at once, though. Instead we use an array

> kk[l=0..#xys]

representing a row of @kk@ for a particular @i@. Initially it is for
@i = -1@, so @kk[0] = -1@ and @kk[l] = \#ys@ otherwise. As the algorithm
progresses we will increase @i@ by one at the outer level and compute
the replacement values for @k@'s elements.

But we want more than just the length of the LCS, we also want the LCS
itself. Another array

> revres[l=0..#xys]

stores the list of @xs@ indices an LCS of length @l@, if one is known,
at @revres[l]@.

Now, suppose @kk@ contains @k[i-1]@. We consider each @j@ in @matchlist[i]@
in turn. We find the @l@ such that @k[l-1] < j <= k[l]@. If @j < k[l]@ then
we updated @k[l]@ to be @j@ and set @revres[l]@ to be @i:revres[l-1]@.

Finding @l@ is basically binary search, but there are some tricks we can
do. First, as the @j@s are decreasing the last @l@ we had for this @i@ is
an upper bound on this @l@. Second, we use another array

> lastl[j=0..#ys-1]

to store the @l@ we got last time for this @j@, initially all @1@. As the
values in @kk[j]@ monotonically decrease this is a lower bound for @l@.
We also test to see whether this old @l@ is still @l@ before we start the
binary search.
